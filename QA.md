[what-if-there-is-not-enough-space-to-draw-ambush](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2372541/what-if-there-is-not-enough-space-to-draw-ambush)

> What if (in a late game) there is no place on the map where I could draw an Ambush (in a multiplayer game)?

From the rule book "If a player cannot legally draw the depicted shape on their neighbor's map, they must instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their neighbor's map and fill it with the monster terrain type."

[great-city-what-if-theres-only-one-village-cluster](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2326507/great-city-what-if-theres-only-one-village-cluster)

> Regarding the Great City, what if there is only one village cluster on the map? Does it still count as the largest one or do you need at least two clusters for this card to score?

If you have only one cluster, it is the largest one. If you have multiple clusters, you sort them by size in a descending order and pick the first one.

[ambush-placement-on-ruins-legal](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2276817/ambush-placement-on-ruins-legal)

> When drawing an Ambush on my opponent's sheet, is it legal to draw it over a ruins space?

Yes, it is legal to draw monster terrain on your opponent's map sheet so that it covers a ruins space. There is often strategic merit in doing so.

[scoring](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3190747/scoring)

> When scoring AB, then BC, then CD, and AD, do I count the same shapes from previous seasons that I already scored in the next seasons?

Yes, you do!

> Should I mark the shapes with coins in a special way to remember to collect coins from them in the following seasons?

As soon as you gain a coin for any reason, you immediately fill in one of the coin circles along the horizontal row beneath the map. When it is time to score, simply count how many coins you have filled in. You will get to count the same coins again in future seasons, plus any additional coins you acquire.

[coins](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2307486/coins)

> Do we score coins cumulatively? For example, do coins collected in Spring add to the coin count in Fall?

Yes, coins are scored cumulatively. Once you collect a coin, you immediately fill in a coin circle, and all filled-in circles are counted at each scoring phase. This is implied in the rulebook, as it instructs players to blacken the coin circles when earned, and they are counted in each scoring round.

[is-a-1x1-square-considered-a-shape](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2890831/is-a-1x1-square-considered-a-shape)

> Is a 1x1 square considered "a shape"?

Yes, a 1x1 square is considered a shape.

[edge-case-filling-the-map](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2346255/edge-case-filling-the-map)

> In solo mode I filled the map with 1 card flip left in Winter of the solo version on the back side of the map. What do I do with the last card flip? Do I ignore the card, and do I still score the coin if the card gives one?

In the rare instance that the map sheet is completely filled, the game immediately ends, and you move directly to scoring. Regarding the coin, if you are forced to place a single square but cannot place it, you do not gain the coin.

[2-ruins-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2283080/2-ruins-card)

> What should I do when 2 Ruins cards come out one after the other? Do I draw the next explore card on a ruin or the next 2 explore cards?

If both Ruins cards come up in a row, draw the next explore card on the Ruins space, not the next two shapes. The rules say "If one or more ruins cards are revealed..."

[borderlands-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2777299/borderlands-question)

> The Borderlands card instructions reads, "Earn six reputation stars for each complete row or complete column of filled spaces." Do the rows or columns have to be on the border of the map, or can they be from any row or column?

Any row or column will score. It does not have to be on the edge of the map.

[scoring-edicts-twice-how-is-this-done](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2526996/scoring-edicts-twice-how-is-this-done)

> How do I score the same edict twice? If I add to a cluster or shape in the next season, do I score it again? How do I keep track of what's new versus what's old as the board fills up?

The game doesn't require you to remember what was scored previously. When it’s time to score a given edict, you evaluate the map in its current state and score it as it is at that moment.

[on-placing-monsters](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2668858/on-placing-monsters)

> When placing monsters in solo mode, I must start at the given corner as dictated by the raid card itself. If I'm unable to draw it, I move to the next corner using the arrow on the card and continue inward one square at a time. Can I change the orientation of the monster raid if no corner can accommodate it?

No, you do not change the orientation of the monster. You move around the edge of the entire board before you move inward one square. You are not allowed to rotate the Ambush shape.

[shield-gate-scoring](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2651761/shield-gate-scoring)

> The Shield Gate scoring card states, "Earn two reputation stars for each village space in the second largest cluster of village spaces." What happens if I only have one cluster of village spaces? Do I still get points?

No, you do not score any points.

> I noticed there are four ambush cards, the spring scoring sheet also has a section for negative points from monster spaces. Is an ambush card added at the beginning of the game in spring?

Yes, an ambush card is added at the beginning of every season, including spring.

[can-you-use-both-terraintypes-on-a-combined-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2940522/can-you-use-both-terraintypes-on-a-combined-card)

> Can you use both terrain types on a combined card? Or would allowing this as a house rule disrupt the game balance?

According to the official rules, you cannot use both terrain types on a combined card; you must choose one type when placing the shape on your map. While it is possible to house-rule this to allow both types, doing so could disrupt game balance, especially with objectives that score based on distinct areas of a single terrain type.

[move-silently-plus-ambush-card-solo-situation](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2482357/move-silently-plus-ambush-card-solo-situation)

> In a solo game of Cartographers, can the Move Silently skill be used with Ambush cards? The skill states "draw the chosen shape," but does that apply to monster shapes, and if so, can it affect their placement?

Officially, the Move Silently skill is not intended to be used with Ambush cards in solo mode. Although Move Silently allows you to adjust placement by choosing the shape's location, Ambush cards follow strict placement rules that the player cannot modify.

[rules-of-greenbough](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3068266/rules-of-greenbough)

> How is scoring calculated for the Greenbough card?

For the Greenbough card, you earn one Reputation Star for each row and each column that contains at least one Forest space. Check each row on your map. If a row has at least one Forest space, score one Reputation Star for that row. Repeat the process for each column. If a column contains at least one Forest space, score one Reputation Star for that column.

Since there are 11 rows and 11 columns, you can score a maximum of 22 Reputation Stars if each row and column contains at least one Forest space. Note that the same Forest space can count once for its row and once for its column. Even if you only place a single Forest space on the map, you will score at least 2 points (one for the row and one for the column it occupies).

[golden-granary-score-card-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2396746/golden-granary-score-card-clarification)

> On the Golden Granary card, the example shows a farm covering a ruins space and water adjacent to another ruins space, scoring a point. However, how are there two adjacent ruins spaces? Is the farm shape meant to be something else to allow water to score?

The ruins spaces on the map are fixed and cannot be adjacent to each other. The example on the Golden Granary card is designed to illustrate scoring possibilities in a limited space. It shows that water spaces score a point if they are adjacent to a ruins space, regardless of whether the ruins is covered or uncovered. The example’s layout is only to clarify this scoring rule and does not represent an actual in-game map configuration.

[scoring-question-shieldgate-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2683387/scoring-question-shieldgate-card)

> For the Shieldgate card, how does scoring work if a player has two clusters of villages with the same number of tiles? The card says to score based on the second-largest cluster, but it’s unclear if ties count or if there needs to be a different-sized group.

Ties are counted for the "second-largest" cluster on the Shieldgate card. If a player has two clusters of village spaces with the same number of tiles, they will score points for one of these clusters as the second-largest.

[monster-spaces-as-allowable-terrrain](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2567415/monster-spaces-as-allowable-terrrain)

> Can monster spaces be used to complete scoring requirements, such as filling rows, columns, or diagonals, or are they considered blockers? We have been playing with monsters as blockers, but I'm not sure if this aligns with the rules.

Yes, monster spaces count as "filled spaces" for all purposes in the game, including completing scoring requirements for rows, columns, and other shapes specified by scoring cards. This means they are not blockers in terms of fulfilling these requirements. Additionally, mountain and wasteland spaces also count as filled for scoring purposes. While it's rare, there may be specific situations where choosing monster terrain can strategically benefit you, such as fulfilling requirements for scoring cards that reward adjacency to multiple terrain types.

[connection-question-stoneside-forest](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2275490/connection-question-stoneside-forest)

> For the Stoneside Forest card, which awards points when a forest cluster connects one mountain to another, does the connection need to be orthogonal, or can it be diagonal?

Connections are always considered orthogonal, not diagonal. This means that for the Stoneside Forest card, a forest cluster must connect mountain spaces by sharing sides, not corners. The game’s adjacency rule specifies that spaces sharing a side are adjacent, while spaces connected only at a diagonal are not.

[ruin-then-ambush-then-ruin-then-explore](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2511667/ruin-then-ambush-then-ruin-then-explore)

> In a solo game, I encountered this sequence in Spring: Outpost Ruin, Goblin Ambush, Temple Ruin, and then Forgotten Forest. I resolved the Ambush and then used Forgotten Forest to cover the ruin space. Is this correct?

Yes, it is correct. When an Ambush appears after a Ruins card, you resolve the Ambush as normal. After that, when the Forgotten Forest (or another explore card) is drawn, it can be placed over the ruin space as usual. This follows the rule on page 5, which states that if two Ruins cards appear consecutively, a third card is drawn and placed on top of both Ruins cards. However, since there was an Ambush in between, you handle it by resolving each card in sequence.

[same-scoring-with-skill-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2445360/same-scoring-with-skill-cards)

> In a solo game, should there be any scoring penalty for using Skill cards? I played with the skills Knowledge and Move Silently and ended up with a high score, which felt unusually lucky. I also wonder if Mountains can be drawn on Ruins spaces.

There is no scoring penalty for using Skill cards, although they do make the game easier and may lead to higher scores. Using Skill cards allows additional strategic options, which can boost your score, especially in solo play. Some players prefer to avoid Skill cards in solo mode for a more challenging experience.

As for drawing on Ruins spaces, you may use any terrain type except Mountains. Although Mountains are listed as a terrain type, they are explicitly excluded from placement on Ruins spaces. This has been confirmed by the rulebook that Ruins spaces should be filled with any terrain type other than Mountains.

[are-shapes-optional-or-mandatory](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3063820/are-shapes-optional-or-mandatory)

> Is it mandatory to draw a shape if it’s unhelpful, or can you opt not to place it? For example, if placing a shape would interfere with a high-scoring area, can you choose to skip it?

Yes, if you are able to place a shape, you must do so. The rules require that any drawable shape must be placed if it fits on the map, even if it might disrupt other scoring opportunities. If there are multiple shape options, and only one fits, you must place that fitting shape. Allowing players to skip shapes would also enable them to avoid placing ambushes, which would go against the intended challenge of the game.

[scoring-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2678513/scoring-question)

> In solo game, if a scoring card (like A) awards points for filling a column or row, do I score that same row or column each time the card scores across multiple rounds? Also, is there a specific adjustment needed for solo scoring?

Yes, in solo play, you score each applicable row or column every time the scoring card is active, which can result in a high score. However, for solo games, you also need to subtract specific values from your final score, as indicated on each scoring card. These values are typically between 18 and 20 points per card and are located in the lower-right corner. The total of these values is subtracted from your final score to determine your solo score. If you scored 74 points without subtracting these, your actual score might be significantly lower.

[wasteland-map-side-b-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2330581/wasteland-map-side-b-question)

> On the Wasteland map (Side B), is the grey area considered "filled" space? For example, does it count as filled space when near a mountain?

Yes, the grey area on Side B of the Wasteland map is considered "filled" space. This means shapes cannot overlap these grey spaces, similar to mountain spaces. However, it does not count as a specific terrain type for scoring purposes on cards that require adjacency to certain terrain types, such as the Greengold Plains card.

[end-of-a-round-ambush-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2307513/end-of-a-round-ambush-card)

> After an Ambush card is revealed and resolved, do we shuffle it back into the deck for the next round, or is it removed from the game?

Once an Ambush card is revealed and resolved, it is removed from the game. It does not get shuffled back into the deck for subsequent rounds.

[monsters-on-edges-of-the-map](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2479784/monsters-on-edges-of-the-map)

> When monsters are placed on the edges of the map, do they count as empty spaces with a -1 penalty, or do they score 0?

Monster spaces on the edges of the map score 0, not -1. The area outside the map does not exist in gameplay terms, so it is not considered an "empty space" for scoring purposes. Thus, placing monsters along the edges can reduce the potential negative impact, especially in solo play, where this positioning can be advantageous.

[great-city-scoring-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2269776/great-city-scoring-card)

> For the Great City scoring card, does a village cluster score if any of its spaces are adjacent to a mountain, or does the entire cluster need to avoid mountain adjacency? Additionally, does each player score their own largest cluster, or is only one player’s cluster scored?

For the Great City card, the entire village cluster must not be adjacent to any mountain spaces to qualify for scoring. If even one space within the cluster is adjacent to a mountain, the whole cluster is disqualified and scores zero points. Each player scores their own map independently, so each player identifies and scores their largest qualifying village cluster. Different players may end up with different scores based on the layout of their maps, and there is no limitation to a single "largest cluster" across all players.

[something-is-wrong](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2413019/something-is-wrong)

> At summer, I had no monsters. Does the big city (13 points) count if it’s the only city? Do the big rivers “count twice” on the mountain if they touch it on multiple sides?

Yes, the big city can score even if it’s the only village cluster, as long as it meets the scoring requirements (i.e., it’s not adjacent to any mountains). For the big rivers, each unique water space adjacent to a mountain scores 2 points, regardless of how many sides it touches, so each water space counts only once per mountain.

[cards-with-two-terrain-choices](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2439149/cards-with-two-terrain-choices)

> For a card like Treetop Village, which offers a choice between village or forest terrain, do you have to use only one terrain type for the entire shape, or can you mix both terrain types within the same shape?

You must choose only one terrain type for the entire shape. Mixing terrain types within the same shape is not allowed. This is clarified in the rules (page 6), which state that each player independently chooses one of the terrain types and one of the available shapes, meaning you commit to a single terrain type for the shape.

[monster-scoring](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2750029/monster-scoring)

> I just played my first game and I lost a point for unfilled squares adjacent to a monster.Do I lose points in each season for the same unfilled squares adjacent to a monster, or is it only counted once?

Yes, you lose points for unfilled squares adjacent to a monster at the end of each season, even if they were counted in previous seasons. Your map is reevaluated at the end of every season, with no memory of previous scores, meaning any unfilled spaces next to monsters will continue to count against you in each scoring phase.

[when-given-a-choice-between-two-shapes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2951501/when-given-a-choice-between-two-shapes)

> If given a choice between two shapes, can I select one that won’t fit on the map to then place a 1x1 square instead? Or must I always choose a shape that I can legally draw?

You must choose a shape that you can legally draw on the map if possible. Only if none of the available shapes can be placed legally on the map are you allowed to place a 1x1 square anywhere. Page 6 of the Cartographers rulebook states that "If a player cannot legally draw any of the available shapes, they must instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their map and fill it with the chosen terrain type". Also in Page 7 of Cartographers Heroes rulebook, it states that "If a player cannot legally draw any of the available shapes, they must instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their map and fill it with any terrain type (excluding mountains)".

[rotate-ambush-shapes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2172672/rotate-ambush-shapes)

> Can shapes from Ambush cards be rotated and flipped like those from regular cards?

In multiplayer mode, Ambush shapes can be rotated and flipped just like regular shapes. However, in solo mode, you cannot rotate or flip Ambush shapes; they must be placed exactly as shown on the card. This distinction is outlined in the solo rules on page 12.

[cluster](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2413140/cluster)

> Does a series of connected, elongated blocks count as a cluster for "Wildholds"? Does a single 1x1 block count as a cluster for "Shoreside Expanse"? For "Shoreside Expanse," if I have two 4x4 blocks attached, do they count as one cluster or two? Lastly, should the scoring cards be arranged in a set order after shuffling, like urban mission in spring, forest in summer, etc.?

Yes, an elongated series of connected blocks does count as a cluster for "Wildholds," as any group of connected spaces with the same terrain type forms a cluster. A single 1x1 block is also considered a cluster for "Shoreside Expanse." For two 4x4 blocks, if they are orthogonally connected, they count as one cluster for "Shoreside Expanse." The scoring cards do not follow a fixed order after shuffling; one card from each mission type is selected at random for each season.

[ruins-and-riftland](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2429468/ruins-and-riftland)

> When a Ruins card is followed by a Riftlands card, does the shape need to be placed on an available Ruins space, or can it be placed anywhere?

Yes, you are correct; the Riftlands shape must be placed on an available Ruins space if one is uncovered. The Ruins requirement applies even for Riftlands, which allows you to place a 1x1 square of any terrain. Only if there is no available Ruins space can the Riftlands shape be placed anywhere.

[ruins-rule-one-of](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2389086/ruins-rule-one-of)

> If a Ruins card is followed by a card with two shape options, and only one of those shapes can legally be drawn to overlap a Ruins space, can I choose to forgo that shape and instead place a 1x1 square anywhere on the map?

No, you cannot opt for the 1x1 square placement if at least one of the available shapes can legally overlap a Ruins space. The 1x1 square rule only applies if neither of the provided shapes can be legally placed on a Ruins space.

[ambush-card-after-ruin-card-during-solo-play](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2172170/ambush-card-after-ruin-card-during-solo-play)

> In solo play, if I draw an Ambush card immediately after a Ruin card and I have no ruins left, should I place the Ambush in the regular shape, place a 1x1 Ambush, or a 1x1 square with any terrain? Additionally, if the Ambush is resolved normally, should the Ruin card then affect the next Explore card?

Ruins do not interact with Ambush cards, so the Ambush is handled normally in its regular shape. After resolving the Ambush, discard it as usual, regardless of the Ruin card. The Ruin card will affect the next Explore card drawn, not the Ambush. If the Ambush shape cannot be legally drawn, it has no effect but is still discarded, even in solo play.

[end-of-season-scoring-recount-coins-and-previously](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2275318/end-of-season-scoring-recount-coins-and-previously)

> When a season ends, should players recount coins and previously scored sections of the map? For coins, does this mean only counting those gained in the last season, or should coins from previous seasons be counted again? Similarly, when scoring objectives, do we re-score sections of the map already counted in past seasons?

Each season's scoring is treated independently, so players should score every coin they have accumulated on their sheet, including those gained in previous seasons. Similarly, they should re-score all relevant sections of the map for each season's objectives, even if they were counted in earlier rounds. This means there is no need to track which areas or coins were already scored in past seasons, as everything applicable on the map is reevaluated for each season's scoring.

[ruin-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3033307/ruin-cards)

> When monster cards are revealed, they are removed from the game. What about ruins? Are ruins cards also removed after they are drawn?

Monster (Ambush) cards are removed from play after they are resolved, meaning they won't reappear in future rounds. However, ruins cards are treated differently; they remain part of the explore deck and are shuffled back in at the end of each season, so they can appear again in later rounds.

[are-ruins-considered-to-be-blank-spaces](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2267470/are-ruins-considered-to-be-blank-spaces)

> Are ruins considered blank spaces unless filled in?

Yes, ruins are treated as blank spaces until they are filled with terrain. This contrasts with mountain and wasteland spaces, which are always considered filled spaces, regardless of any additions.

[greengold-plains-and-wasteland](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2302305/greengold-plains-and-wasteland)

> Does the wasteland terrain on the Wasteland map count as a terrain type for scoring the Greengold Plains card? For example, if a village cluster touches water, forest, and wasteland but no other types, will it score?

Wasteland spaces count as filled spaces but do not count as a terrain type, as they are not included in the list of terrain types on the Greengold Plains card or in the rulebook (page 7). Therefore, the village cluster in this example would not score for Greengold Plains.

[rift-gateambush-draw-on-opponents-sheet](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3132501/rift-gateambush-draw-on-opponents-sheet)

> When using a Rift Gate card, are players allowed to draw a monster square on an opponent's sheet, similar to an Ambush card?

No, since the Rift Gate card is a regular explore card and not an Ambush card, players draw the chosen terrain, including a monster square if selected, on their own sheet. While selecting a monster square on your own map might occasionally be strategically useful, it remains situational and must be placed on the player's own board.

[cant-fit-a-shape-so-that-it-overlaps-a-ruin-clarif](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2456179/cant-fit-a-shape-so-that-it-overlaps-a-ruin-clarif)

> If I draw a Ruins card and cannot fit any of the available shapes on the Ruins space but still have Ruins spaces open on my map, do I have to place a 1x1 square on an open Ruins space, or can I place it anywhere? Also, can I use any terrain type, or must it be one of the options from the Ruins card?

If you cannot legally place any of the available shapes on a Ruins space, you may place a 1x1 square anywhere on your map, not necessarily on a Ruins space. According to the revised rules, this square can be filled with any terrain type except mountains.

[ambush-in-solo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2347338/ambush-in-solo)

> In solo mode, if an Ambush shape overlaps with a Ruins icon, am I required to place it there, or can I avoid covering the Ruins?

Yes, in solo mode, you must place the Ambush shape on the Ruins icon if it is the first legal position available for the Ambush.

[wildholds-scoring-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2616618/wildholds-scoring-card)

> With the Wildholds scoring card, if I have a single cluster of 12 village spaces, do I score 8 points or 16 points?

You would score 8 points. The Wildholds card provides 8 VP for each cluster of six or more village spaces, regardless of the size beyond six spaces. Therefore, a cluster of 12 village spaces would still only earn 8 points.

[negociation-plus-filled-ruin-spaces](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2794579/negociation-plus-filled-ruin-spaces)

> If I draw a ruins card but have no more available ruin spaces, meaning I must draw only one square, can I still use the Negotiate skill? If so, am I limited to the terrain types on the drawn card, or can I use any terrain type as per the rule for unavailable ruins?

Yes, you can use the Negotiate skill to draw a 2x2 shape in this situation. Since no ruin spaces are available, the rule allows you to draw a 1x1 square of any terrain type. Using Negotiate allows you to draw a 2x2 shape, and you can choose any terrain type (excluding mountains), as per the unavailable ruins rule.

[5-rulesscoring-questions](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2279937/5-rulesscoring-questions)

> Does adjacency include diagonal spaces? For example, would water spaces diagonally adjacent to a ruin count for the Golden Granary scoring card?

Adjacency does not include diagonal spaces; only spaces directly above, below, left, and right are considered adjacent. So, for the Golden Granary scoring, only water spaces orthogonally adjacent to ruin spaces will count.

> For "The Broken Road" scoring card, does a complete diagonal line require certain empty spaces to remain unfilled, or can filled squares be adjacent to each other within the diagonal line?

For "The Broken Road," the shaded spaces on the card represent filled areas of any terrain type, including monsters, and the complete diagonal lines do not require specific empty spaces. For example, if you filled a 2x2 square in the lower-left, it would score both lines that intersect in that area.

> When scoring "Lost Barony," does the largest square of filled spaces have to be an actual square, or can I score the largest square area within an irregularly shaped filled space?

When scoring "Lost Barony," you must create an actual square shape. Your filled area needs to form the largest possible square with orthogonally connected filled spaces.

> What defines a "cluster" for cards like "Shieldgate"? Are clusters limited by adjacent spaces only, or can diagonal spaces also form a cluster?

For clusters, spaces must be orthogonally adjacent. Diagonal spaces do not connect to form a cluster. So, for scoring purposes, only adjacent spaces that share an edge are considered part of a cluster.

> For monsters, when losing reputation points, does adjacency to empty spaces include diagonal spaces?

For monster adjacency scoring, only orthogonally adjacent empty spaces cause a loss of reputation points. Diagonal empty spaces do not count as adjacent for this purpose.

[question-about-great-city-scoring](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2432952/question-about-great-city-scoring)

> For the Great City scoring card, if a village cluster is adjacent to a mountain space, does it score nothing? Or should you count only the village spaces within the cluster that are not adjacent to a mountain?

If any part of the village cluster is adjacent to a mountain space, that entire cluster scores nothing for the Great City card. To score, you need to identify your largest village cluster that has no spaces adjacent to a mountain. Only that cluster, if it exists, will score one reputation star for each space in it. If your largest cluster is next to a mountain, you must skip it and find the next largest cluster that is not adjacent to any mountain spaces. Additionally, you only need one cluster to score; having two clusters is not required.

[in-great-city-can-i-define-only-spaces-that-share](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2728126/in-great-city-can-i-define-only-spaces-that-share)

> In Great City scoring, are clusters defined only by spaces that share a side (orthogonal adjacency), or can spaces connected only by a diagonal also form a cluster?

For Great City scoring, clusters are defined by spaces that share a side with each other, meaning they must be orthogonally adjacent (above, below, left, or right). Spaces that are only connected diagonally are not part of the same cluster. Each cluster must be a contiguous group of spaces with the same terrain type, where each space is connected to at least one other space within the cluster by a shared side. As an exception, a cluster can consist of a single space if it is isolated from others.

> If I pay for a skill card in the Skills Mini Expansion, should I erase the coins from the track, allowing me to earn them again, or should I cross them out permanently?

Do not erase the coins. Instead, cross them out on your coin track, following the instructions on the rules card that comes with the Skills Mini Expansion. Coins that have been crossed out do not count towards scoring, but the spaces on your coin track remain filled, indicating that those coins have been earned and spent, thus exhausting their points value.

[about-adjacent-shapes](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2312421/about-adjacent-shapes)

> The rules in the rulebook say that shapes may not be drawn adjacent to any previously drawn shapes on the map. However, I see players in videos drawing shapes adjacent to others. Is this allowed?

The rule states: "The chosen shape does not have to be drawn adjacent to any shapes previously drawn on the map," which means adjacency is optional. You can draw shapes adjacent to others, but it is not required. Placing shapes adjacent to others is permitted and often necessary for scoring.

> When selecting decrees, is each decree slot assigned a specific type of scoring card, or can any type of scoring card be placed in any decree slot?

Any scoring card can be placed in any decree slot (A, B, C, or D). There's no requirement to assign specific types of scoring cards to specific decree slots.

[skills](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2669741/skills)

> When using skill cards, can multiple players use the same skill card during the same season, or is it restricted to one use per season?

Yes, multiple players can use the same skill card in the same season if they each pay the associated coin cost. There is no restriction on how many players can use the same skill card within a season. However, each player may only use one skill per season, so while they can choose from any of the three available skill cards, they cannot activate more than one skill per season.

[how-to-count-points-for-path-of-forests](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2699071/how-to-count-points-for-path-of-forests)

> For the "Path of Forests" scoring card, how are points counted? If four mountains are connected, is the score 12 points (3 for each connected mountain) or 24 points (6 for each possible path between mountains)?

The score for "Path of Forests" is 3 points for each connected mountain. So if you have four mountains connected, the score would be 12 points total, not 24. Each mountain only counts for a single 3-point connection, even if it is part of multiple paths.

[stoneside-forest-card](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2390607/stoneside-forest-card)

> For the Stoneside Forest card, how should mountain connections be scored? If all five mountains are connected in a loop, does this increase the score beyond 15 points in one season?

Each mountain space connected to another mountain space by a cluster of forest spaces scores 3 points. The scoring is per mountain, not per connection. Therefore, even if you connect all five mountains together in a loop, you still score only a maximum of 15 points for that season (3 points per mountain, with each mountain counting only once).

[ambush-and-arrow-direction-in-solo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2264527/ambush-and-arrow-direction-in-solo)

> How do ambush cards work in solo mode, particularly regarding placement along the map’s edge? What is the "arrow" the manual refers to?

In solo mode, ambush cards specify a starting corner for placement, which is highlighted in purple in the top right corner of the card. After attempting to place the ambush shape in this corner, if it doesn't fit, the shape should be moved along the edge of the map in the direction indicated by the arrow on the bottom of the card (clockwise or counterclockwise). If the shape still cannot be placed after one full rotation along the map edge, you may begin another rotation one space closer to the center.

[largest-cluster-ties](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2310688/largest-cluster-ties)

> For scoring cards that require checking the largest cluster, like Great City, what happens if there is a tie between two clusters of the same size?

If you have multiple clusters of the same size that both meet the scoring criteria (e.g., two village clusters each containing 5 spaces and neither is adjacent to a mountain for Great City scoring), you score points based on one of those clusters. So, in this case, you would score 5 reputation stars for one of the clusters, ignoring the other.

[rift-lands-explore-card-why-monster-terrain-type](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2262442/rift-lands-explore-card-why-monster-terrain-type)

> The explore card allows you to draw a 1x1 square of any terrain type, including the "monster" terrain. Is there any scenario where choosing the monster terrain type would be beneficial, and why is it included as an option?

Choosing the monster terrain with the Rift Lands card is rarely advantageous, but it can help meet specific goals that require clusters to be adjacent to multiple terrain types, like Greengold Plains. Monsters count as a unique terrain type, allowing players to fulfill such conditions without merging clusters or disrupting other scoring opportunities. Including monsters as an option also keeps the rules straightforward and allows flexibility for future expansions where monster terrain might gain more strategic value.

[card-questions-shoreside-expanse-and-the-broken-ro](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2418063/card-questions-shoreside-expanse-and-the-broken-ro)

> For the Shoreside Expanse and The Broken Road scoring cards, do clusters for Shoreside need to stay as isolated islands to collect points? And for The Broken Road, do the diagonal lines need to remain isolated?

For Shoreside Expanse, clusters of farms and water do not need to remain isolated or as islands to score points. As long as each cluster does not touch another cluster of the same type (farm with farm or water with water) or a map edge, those clusters earn 3 victory points. Forests, villages, or other types of spaces can be adjacent without affecting scoring.

For The Broken Road, the diagonal lines do not need to remain isolated. You score for each complete diagonal line of filled spaces that touches both the left and bottom edges of the map. The illustration on the scoring card is intended to show examples but does not impose any requirement for isolation.

[greengold-plains-and-mountains](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2391336/greengold-plains-and-mountains)

> Do mountain spaces count as one of the terrain types for scoring the Greengold Plains card?

Yes, mountain spaces do count as one of the terrain types for scoring the Greengold Plains card. The card requires three or more different terrain types, and mountains can be included as one of these types. However, players cannot draw additional mountain spaces; they can only use pre-printed mountain spaces on the map for this scoring.

[asymmetric-start](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2471510/asymmetric-start)

> Does Cartographers have a way to ensure asymmetric or varied decisions among players?

While Cartographers begins with the same options for all players, the game offers so many placement choices that players’ maps naturally diverge. There are no rules enforcing asymmetry, but the variety of options each player faces with each card draw usually leads to unique board layouts. Some players choose to make maps hidden until reveal phases to avoid the possibility of copying, though this is not common. The only direct interaction occurs when placing monster cards on opponents’ maps, so generally, each player’s board will develop independently based on personal strategies and priorities.

[wildholds-and-ruins](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2250579/wildholds-and-ruins)

> For the Wildholds scoring card, do clusters of villages need to be separated by blank spaces or other terrain? Additionally, if there are adjacent smaller clusters, can these be combined into a larger scoring cluster?

Each cluster of villages for Wildholds must be separated by blank spaces or other types of terrain to count as individual clusters. If adjacent village spaces are all connected, they are considered one large cluster, regardless of the original groups. So, in your example, if you have two clusters of three and two clusters of five village spaces that are all adjacent to each other, they would collectively form a single 16-space cluster rather than multiple clusters for scoring purposes.

> For Ruins spaces, can these be built on at any time, and does the rule requiring placement on Ruins spaces only apply when a Ruins card is revealed?

Yes, Ruins spaces can be filled at any time during the game. However, when a Ruins card is revealed, players must attempt to place the shape on an unfilled Ruins space. If no Ruins spaces are available or if the shape doesn’t fit, players can place a 1x1 square with any terrain type anywhere on their map instead.

[stoneside-forest-scoring-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2506408/stoneside-forest-scoring-question)

> In the Stoneside Forest scoring card, if I connect three mountains with one forest cluster and two other mountains with a separate forest cluster (the two forests are not connected), how many points do I score?

You would score 15 points each season. For Stoneside Forest, each individual mountain space that connects to at least one other mountain by a forest cluster scores 3 points. The forest clusters do not need to be connected to each other.

[map-affril-edges-of-the-map-equal-edges-of-each-is](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2834640/map-affril-edges-of-the-map-equal-edges-of-each-is)

> In the map Affril, do the edges of each island count as "edges of the map" for scoring purposes, especially in scoring cards from the base game that mention map edges (e.g., Sentinel Woods)?

Yes, on the Affril map, each island’s edge is considered an "edge of the map" for scoring purposes in relevant scoring cards like Sentinel Woods and Treetower.

[do-ambushhero-cards-have-available-shapes-or-avail](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3021807/do-ambushhero-cards-have-available-shapes-or-avail)

> Can skills that refer to "available shapes" or "available terrain types" (like Cure Wounds, Knowledge, Negotiate, etc.) be used with Ambush or Hero cards?

No, skills that reference "available shapes" or "available terrain types" are only applicable to Explore cards. Ambush and Hero cards are part of the Explore deck but are not considered Explore cards themselves and do not contain "available shapes" or "available terrain types." Therefore, skills that rely on these attributes cannot be used when resolving Ambush or Hero cards.

[ambush-cards](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2433884/ambush-cards)

> When Ambush squares are placed on your map by another player, do they count toward completing rows/columns for scoring, or do they disrupt an otherwise complete row/column?

Yes, Ambush (monster) squares count as filled spaces when determining completed rows and columns. All filled spaces—including Ambush squares, mountains, and any special wasteland spaces on the B-side of the map—are valid for completing rows or columns and contributing to scoring.

[ulems-wallow](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3264475/ulems-wallow)

> In Ulem's Wallow, why does only one water space earn points, even though all four water spaces are located near multiple farms?

Only individual water spaces with two or more adjacent (non-diagonal) farm spaces qualify for scoring in Ulem's Wallow. In this case, only one specific water space meets this criterion. Adjacent spaces in this game are defined as sharing an edge (above, below, or to the sides), so diagonal adjacency does not count toward scoring.

[coin-shapes-vs-ruins](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2641336/coin-shapes-vs-ruins)

> If a card with a shape that includes a coin is drawn after a Ruins card, and I cannot place that shape on a Ruins space, resulting in a 1x1 square placement, do I still get the coin?

No, you do not earn the coin if you are unable to draw the specific shape indicated on the card. The coin bonus is only awarded when you successfully draw the exact shape with the coin symbol.

[shieldgate-edict](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2488405/shieldgate-edict)

> How does scoring work for the Shieldgate edict when there are tied clusters? If I have two villages of 5 tiles each, do I score anything? If I have three villages with sizes 5, 5, and 3 tiles, do I score for a 5-tile village or the 3-tile village?

Yes, you do score. When the top two villages are tied for the largest size, you can pick one of them to count as the second-largest and score points for that village. In the case of three villages of sizes 5, 5, and 3, you can consider one of the 5-tile villages as your second-largest village, allowing you to score 5 points for that cluster.

[affril-scoring-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3371877/affril-scoring-question)

[undercity](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2932150/undercity)

> In the Undercity map, must all individual squares in a shape trace back to the gate, or is it only required that the shape as a whole connects back to the gate?

Yes, all squares in a shape must trace back to the gate through orthogonal connections (i.e., sharing an edge). This rule can indeed make some shapes more challenging to place, especially those with diagonal configurations. However, it adds a unique strategic layer to the game by limiting placement options, encouraging creative planning, and rewarding effective use of available space.

If a shape cannot be placed in a way that connects each square back to the gate, you are permitted to draw a 1x1 shape of any non-mountain terrain anywhere on the map as a substitute. While this restriction initially feels limiting, many players find it becomes an engaging part of the Undercity map’s challenge over time.

> When using the "Acrobatics" skill in solo play, does the 2x1 shape need to cover the very first available square indicated by the starting placement rules for Ambush cards?

Yes, when using Acrobatics in solo play, the 2x1 shape must still adhere to the starting placement requirements, beginning with the very first available square indicated by the Ambush card. This means that if square A1 is the first open space, the Acrobatics shape must include A1 and proceed from there, typically covering A1 and B1 or a similar configuration based on availability, without skipping the first required square.

[lost-barony](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2752432/lost-barony)

> In the Lost Barony, if I only have a single filled square, does it score 3 points?

Yes, a single filled square can score 3 points in the Lost Barony scoring. According to the scoring rule for Lost Barony, you "earn three reputation stars for each space along one edge of the largest square of filled spaces." If the largest square of filled spaces on your map is only 1x1, it still qualifies as a square, and you would earn three reputation stars for that single square.

[draw-monsters-over-ruins](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2932394/draw-monsters-over-ruins)

> In a competitive game, can I draw monster shapes over ruins on my opponent's map, or are there restrictions?

Yes, you can draw monster shapes over ruins on your opponent's map without restrictions. Monster cards are not part of the regular card sequence, so you are free to place them over any space, including ruins, as long as the shape fits in the designated area.

[check-phase-and-drawing-a-ruins-card-1st2nd-to-sta](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2377457/check-phase-and-drawing-a-ruins-card-1st2nd-to-sta)

> If the time threshold is met or exceeded during the Check Phase, do I skip drawing the current card and proceed directly to the season's end? Additionally, if the first card of a season is a Ruins card, do I follow the standard Ruins protocol, or is it ignored?

In the Time Threshold (Check Phase), you only check if the time threshold is met after the Draw Phase is complete. So, if you are at 7 out of a threshold of 8, you will still draw the next card, even if its time value would exceed the limit. After drawing, you proceed to the Check Phase where, if the total now meets or exceeds the threshold, the season ends immediately.

In Starting Season with a Ruins Card, if a Ruins card is the first drawn card of a season, it is resolved as normal. This means you immediately reveal a second card to place on top of the Ruins card, and you apply the Ruins rule to that second card. There is no special exception for the first turn of the season; the Ruins rule applies the same way on any turn.

[golden-granary-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2463791/golden-granary-question)

> if you have a 3x3 square completely covered in water with a ruin in the center, does the player score four points?

The scoring for water adjacent to a ruin is 1 point for each water space orthogonally adjacent to a ruin. In this game, "adjacent" is considered orthogonal (not diagonal). So for a 3x3 square with water surrounding a central ruin space, each orthogonally adjacent water space would score 1 point that scoring season. Additionally, a ruin is always considered a ruin space, even if it is covered by another terrain.

> In the drawing phase, if a player cannot legally draw a shape from the exploration card, should they draw a 1x1 shape with a terrain type of their choice, or must it be one of the terrain types specified on the card?

If a player cannot legally draw the shape shown on the exploration card, they should instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their map. According to the latest rule clarification, this square can be filled with any terrain type of the player's choice, excluding mountains.

[acrobatics-skill-solo-version](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2641326/acrobatics-skill-solo-version)

> In solo mode, if I use the Acrobatics skill, can I choose where to place the monster area, or do I have to follow the solo monster placement rules? Also, can I rotate the monster shape after applying Acrobatics?

In solo mode, you must follow the monster placement rules, starting in the corner indicated by the ambush card and proceeding along the edge of the map as directed by the arrow. The Acrobatics skill allows you to change the shape to either 1x2 or 2x1, but it does not alter the placement corner or direction. Additionally, rotation or mirroring of the monster shape is not allowed in solo mode. However, since Acrobatics permits the shape to be drawn as either 1x2 or 2x1, this flexibility typically makes further rotation unnecessary.

[sugestion-for-ambushes-in-solo](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2295152/sugestion-for-ambushes-in-solo)

> In solo play, ambush cards seem to be discarded often unless they appear at the very beginning of the game. Is there an official rule for mirroring or rotating the ambush shape if it doesn't fit on the map, or is discarding the only option?

In solo play, if an ambush shape cannot be placed along the edge of the map, you should not discard it immediately. The official rule requires you to go around the map edge once and then move inward one space. Repeat this process, circling the map and moving one space closer to the center each time, until you find a place for the ambush or reach the center. Only if the shape still doesn’t fit after this entire process should it be discarded. This method minimizes the chances of needing to discard an ambush.

[lost-barony](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2264124/lost-barony)

> For the Lost Barony scoring, does a 2x2 square need to be isolated with no other tiles touching it, or can it be part of a larger cluster of filled tiles? Also, is there a limit to the size of the square due to mountain or wasteland spaces on the map?

For Lost Barony scoring, a 2x2 square does not need to be isolated and can be part of a larger cluster of filled tiles. Any 2x2 area within a larger filled section can count, as long as it forms a complete square. Regarding the maximum square size, mountain and wasteland spaces are considered "filled spaces" for the purpose of scoring. This means they can be included in the square, allowing for larger configurations beyond just 3x3. This clarification is noted in the rulebook (page 6).

[shieldgate-question](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2248798/shieldgate-question)

> How should Shieldgate scoring work if I have three village clusters of sizes 8, 8, and 3? Is one of the clusters with size 8 considered the "second largest," or do they both count as the largest?

In the Shieldgate scoring scenario, if you have village clusters of sizes 8, 8, and 3, one of the 8-sized clusters is considered the second largest. Therefore, you would score it as the second-largest village.

> How do you properly score the Canal Lake scoring card in Cartographers? Specifically, does each farm or water space score only once, and is there an efficient way to calculate the score?

For Canal Lake scoring, each farm space adjacent to a water space scores 1 point, and each water space adjacent to a farm space also scores 1 point. Each space can only score once, regardless of how many adjacent spaces of the other type it has. This means you do not score clusters but rather check each individual farm and water space for adjacency and count accordingly.

This is referring to the hero space only. To be consistent with theme, Hortgully the expert dungeon builder in Stonespine Architects benefits from being next to the mountains where he builds his dungeons so you get a coin. The attack pattern could not be adjacent while the hero is and you would still get a coin.

> How should scoring be calculated in solo mode for Cartographers, particularly regarding end-of-game scoring adjustments and seasonal scoring?

In solo mode, scoring includes an adjustment at the end of the game after the last season (Winter). You need to subtract a value from your total score, based on the "rating" numbers in the small grey star at the bottom right of each edict card (A, B, C, D). This number is not the same as the scoring values in the corners of your scoreboxes on the map but rather a solo-specific rating adjustment that can affect your final total.

When a ruins card is drawn, it requires that the shape on the next explore card must be placed on a ruins space if available.

[ambush-card-clarification](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2690719/ambush-card-clarification)

> If I draw terrain over a ruins space (like water), does it remove the ruins, and can I still score adjacency to that space as a ruin? Also, is a terrain-covered ruins space considered "filled"?

Drawing terrain over a ruins space does not remove or nullify the ruins; the ruins designation remains active.

[different-icons-in-shape](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2472303/different-icons-in-shape)

> When you get an exploration like Fishing Village, do you only pick one terrain for entire shape or can you mix and match?

You select one terrain type for the shape. In page 6 of the rules, it states "After drawing the chosen shape, a player fills the shape with the chosen terrain type."
