## Overview (page 2)

In Cartographers, players compete to earn the most reputation stars by the
time four seasons have passed.

Each season, players draw on their map sheets and earn reputation by carrying
out the queen’s edicts before the season is over.

The player with the most reputation stars at the end of winter wins!

## Game Setup (Page 4)

1. Give each player a blank **map sheet**. Players collectively decide whether to use the wilderness side (A) or the wastelands side (B).
2. Give each player a **pencil**. If playing with more than four players, additional pencils will need to be provided.
3. Have each player write a **name** for their cartographer at the top of their map sheet, optionally adding a title and family crest.

>An Image that decipts a half player’s map, with a "THUNDERLAND" displayed on the banner having a crown on it and below it is a two crossed swords are positioned under a badge, creating a crest-like appearance.  At the right is the Cartographer name and title and to the left  is a compass rose is included, adding a navigational element. It features traditional cardinal directions (N, S, E, W). 

4. Arrange the four **edict cards** in a face-up row in the center of the play area, so that they are in alphabetical order (Edict A, Edict B, etc.).
5. Separate the **scoring cards** into four stacks according to their card backs. Shuffle the stacks separately, then randomly draw one card from each stack. Place one of these scoring cards in any order below each of the edict cards, face up. Return the rest of the scoring cards to the game box.
6. Place the four **season cards** in a face-up stack, arranged in order by the progression of seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter). The spring card should be visible on top of the stack.
7. Shuffle the four **ambush cards** to form a face-down deck, then place this ambush deck off to one side of the play area.
8. Shuffle the **explore cards** to form a face-down deck. Take the top card of the ambush deck and shuffle it into this explore deck, without revealing it. Finally, place the explore deck next to the stack of season cards.
9. The game is ready to begin!

## How to Play (Page 5)

The game is played over four **seasons**. Each season is divided into multiple **turns**, and each turn has three **phases**: the Explore Phase, Draw Phase, and Check Phase. At the end of each season, players earn reputation stars.

### 1. Explore Phase (Page 5)

Reveal the top card of the explore deck and place it face up in the center of the play area, so that all players can see it. Place the new card on top of any explore cards already in play, displaying the cards in a column to ensure that the time values on all revealed cards are visible.

- If the first revealed card is a ruins card, immediately reveal another card from the explore deck and place it on top of the ruins card.

- If the second revealed card is also a ruins card, immediately reveal another card from the explore deck and place it on top of both ruins cards.

The ruins card, marked by a symbol of broken stone, is displayed first, followed by a forest card, marked by a cluster of trees. The second card has a title of "Forgotten Forest" and a time value of 1 and both cards are displayed in a column so that the time values are visible.

### 2. Draw Phase (Page 6)

At the same time, each player independently chooses one of the **terrain types** and one of the available **shapes** depicted on the revealed explore card, then draws it on their map with a pencil.

- The chosen shape cannot overlap filled spaces or the edges of the map. (Mountain spaces and wasteland spaces are filled spaces.)
- The chosen shape does not have to be drawn adjacent to any shapes previously drawn on the map.

> image showing the setup of the game. The top part of the image illustrates a 3x3 grid surrounding a mountain space in the center. The mountain is marked with a red "X," indicating it is an impassable space. The six surrounding spaces are filled and marked with green checkmarks, showing that the mountain is fully surrounded, fulfilling the requirement to earn a coin for completing the mountain objective. The bottom part of the image features a "Forgotten Forest" explore card. This card displays a forest terrain type and a specific shape that players must draw on their map. The highlighted shape is a Tetris-like configuration made up of four connected squares. Below the card, the same shape is illustrated on a player's map sheet, where each square is filled with the forest terrain symbol. The black circle magnifies the Tetris shape from the card, helping players visualize and replicate it on their map during the Draw Phase.

- The chosen shape may be drawn so that it overlaps a ruins space on the map.
- The chosen shape can be rotated and/or flipped as needed before it is drawn on the map.
- After drawing the chosen shape, a player fills the shape with the chosen terrain type.
- If a player cannot legally draw any of the available shapes, they must instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their map and fill it with any terrain type (excluding mountains).

The top-left and top-right tiles feature wave-like symbols, while the bottom-left and bottom-right tiles each contain an upward arrow symbol. The red border highlights these surrounding tiles, possibly indicating an important interaction or a region of influence in the game context.

- Each mountain space has four adjacent spaces. If a player surrounds a mountain space by filling all four adjacent spaces, they fill in the next coin symbol on their coin track.
- Some shapes come with a coin. If a player chooses a shape with a coin, they fill in the next coin symbol on their coin track.

The track is a horizontal bar marked with a series of coin symbols, representing the progression of earned coins. A red circle highlights the third coin symbol on the track, indicating that the player has earned two coins so far. The left side of the track features a crossed square marker, which is used to visually track the total number of coins earned.

#### Terrain Types (Page 7)

- **Forest**: Depicted by a collection of three green trees.
- **Village**: Shown as a red house icon.
- **Farm**: Illustrated by golden diagonal lines, representing fields of crops.
- **Water**: Represented by blue wavy lines symbolizing a body of water.
- **Monster**: Depicted by a purple silhouette of a creature with horns.
- **Mountain**: Shown as brown jagged peaks with a golden coin symbol inside.

> Six terrain types shown in a row, each represented by a distinct symbol. Forest has green trees, Village has a red house, Farm is shown with golden crop lines, Water has wavy blue lines, Monster has a purple creature silhouette, and Mountain is depicted by jagged peaks with a gold coin.

##### Rift Lands (page 7)

> A card titled "Rift Lands" featuring bright colors with the instruction to draw a 1x1 square and fill it with a terrain type.

If the **rift lands** card is revealed, each player draws a 1x1 square anywhere on their map and fills it with any terrain type shown on the card. All normal rules and restrictions apply.

##### Ruins (page 7)

> A card titled "Outpost Ruins" with an image of a tower in the wilderness, signifying the ruins feature in the game.

If one or more ruins cards are revealed, each player must draw one of the available shapes depicted on the next explore card that is revealed, so that it overlaps a ruins space on their map (if possible).

If a player cannot legally draw one of the available shapes so that it overlaps a ruins space — OR — if there are no unfilled ruins spaces left on their map — they must instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their map and fill it with any terrain type (excluding mountains).

##### Ambush (page 7)

> A card titled "Ambush" with an image of a direction arrow and a blocky shape made up of four squares.

If an ambush card is revealed, check the direction of the arrow shown on the card. Each player immediately passes their map sheet to their neighbor in that direction.

Each player draws the depicted shape on their neighbor’s map, then fills the shape with the monster terrain type.

If a player cannot legally draw the depicted shape on their neighbor’s map, they must instead draw a 1x1 square anywhere on their neighbor’s map and fill it with the monster terrain type.

Then pass all map sheets back to their owners and discard the ambush card, returning it to the game box.

**Note**: If an ambush card is revealed immediately after a ruins card, the ambush card is resolved normally. The effect of the ruins card will apply to the next explore card that is revealed.

### 3. Check Phase (Page 8)

Check to see if the end of the season has been reached.

Examine the current season card to find the time threshold. For example, spring has a time threshold of eight.

Add together the time values of all explore cards that are currently revealed in the column.

- If the total meets or exceeds the time threshold, the current season ends. Proceed immediately to the end of the season.
- If the total is less than the time threshold, the current season continues. Return to the Explore Phase.

> An image showing a combination of cards and calculations for determining the total time for the Spring season. In the top left corner, the Spring card is displayed, with a large "8" indicating the time threshold for the season. To the right of the Spring card, a column of five explore cards is shown, each with its respective time value listed on the left. These cards display a variety of terrains, including forests, villages, and ruins. The time values on the cards are: 1, 2, 2, 2, and 1, adding up to 8, which meets the time threshold for the Spring season. The time calculation is shown on the right in a vertical format, starting from 0 and incrementing based on the time values of the revealed cards, eventually reaching the total of 8.

## End of the Season (Page 8)

At the end of each season, players are evaluated, earning reputation stars based on how well they followed the queen’s edicts.

### Scoring the Queen's Edicts (Page 8)

Examine the current season card to see which two scoring cards to evaluate. For example, in spring, evaluate the scoring cards below edicts A and B.

> An image showing a scoring section. On the left side, two boxes are highlighted with red borders. These boxes are labeled "A" and "B," representing the edicts that are being scored in the current season. Below the "A" box is a coin symbol, and below the "B" box is a monster symbol, indicating the types of scoring elements that will be evaluated. To the right is a card labeled "Spring," showing a time value of "8" at the top. The Spring card also displays edicts A and B, confirming that these are the edicts to be scored during this season.

- Each player evaluates their own map to determine how many reputation stars they earn for each of **the two scoring cards** being evaluated this season, writing those numbers in the corresponding boxes.
  (See pages 10–11 for details on the scoring cards.)
- Each player earns one reputation star for **each filled-in coin symbol** on their coin track, writing that number in the corresponding box.
- Each player loses one reputation star for **each empty space adjacent to a monster space** on their map, writing that number in the corresponding box. (If an empty space is adjacent to multiple monster spaces, the player still only loses one reputation star for that space.)

If the current season is winter, the game is now over; proceed to the end of the
game. Otherwise, prepare for the next season.

### Preparing for the Next Season (Page 9)

Discard the top card of the season stack, returning it to the game box. This will reveal the next season card in the stack.

Reshuffle the explore deck, including all explore cards revealed this season. Then take the top card of the ambush deck and shuffle it into the explore deck, without revealing it.

**Note:** If an ambush card in the explore deck is not revealed during a season,
it remains in the explore deck for the next season, and an additional ambush
card is added! In this way, it is possible to have multiple ambush cards in the
explore deck during later seasons.

## End of the Game (Page 9)

Once winter has ended and players have been evaluated for the fourth time, the game is over.

Each player totals the reputation stars that they earned across all four seasons, writing their final score on their map sheet. The player with the most reputation stars is the winner!

In the event of a tie, the tied player who lost the least reputation stars to monster terrain across all four seasons is the winner. If there is a further tie, all tied players share the victory.

## Scoring Cards (Page 9-11)

When scoring, keep in mind these general rules:

- Spaces that share a side with each other are adjacent. Spaces that are only at diagonals with each other are not adjacent.
- A group of connected spaces that all have the same terrain type is a cluster. Clusters can have any number of spaces (including just a single space).
- Monster spaces, mountain spaces, and wasteland spaces all count as filled spaces. Only filled ruins spaces count as filled spaces.

## Solo Mode (Page 12)

Set off as a lone cartographer to explore the Kingdom of Nalos. In solo mode, you attempt to earn a prestigious title from Queen Gimnax at the end of your journey! Gameplay has the following changes:

### Changes to Setup (Page 12)

Do not write a title on your map sheet. This is where you’ll record the title appointed to you by Queen Gimnax at the end of the game.

### Changes to Ambushes (Page 12)

When an ambush card is revealed, examine the grid in the upper right corner of the card to see which corner of the map is shown.

On your map sheet, starting in the corner indicated by the ambush card, and proceeding along the edges of the map in the direction indicated by the arrow, attempt to legally draw the monster shape without flipping or rotating it.

If you cannot legally draw the monster shape anywhere along the edge of the map, move one space in from the edge and attempt it again, starting in the same corner and proceeding in the same direction.

Repeat this process, moving one space further in from the edge of the map each time, until you are able to legally draw the monster shape or confirm that it cannot be legally drawn. If the shape cannot be legally drawn, disregard the ambush card.

### Changes to Scoring (Page 12)

After determining your score, total the numbers in the lower corners of the four scoring cards in play.

Then Subtract that total from your score to find your rating.

Queen Gimnax awards you a title based on the highest rating that you met or surpassed:
